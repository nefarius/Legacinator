The one and only Legacinator.

## About

Ever wondered why that darn game controller just won't show up in games, Steam or your favourite emulator? Machine
crashes once you plug in a DualShock 3/4? Struggling with getting that lid off of your pickles jar? Well, I can't help
you with that, but for the game controller issues, read on!

The Legacinator is a simple self-contained .NET 4.8 application that has one task: it scans your machine for traces of
known legacy (outdated, potentially faulty) device drivers (leftovers
from [ScpToolkit](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit), outdated [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus) copies
etc.) and provides a solution to the user.

## Features

- Detects and removes drivers from [ScpToolkit](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit) installations
- Detects and removes [HidGuardian](https://github.com/nefarius/HidGuardian)
- Detects and removes outdated versions of [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus)
- Detects and removes outdated versions of [HidHide](https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide)
- Detects the [HP fork of ViGEmBus from 2018](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/issues/99) and offers mitigation
  instructions
- Detects and fixes [outdated updater agent configuration](https://docs.nefarius.at/projects/ViGEm/End-of-Life/).
- Offers wiping the [HidHide](https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide) configuration parameters

components found:

Clicking them will either attempt an instant automatic fix or open a link to online articles on how to get rid of them
in a safe and supported way. A few more detection examples:
